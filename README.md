# DocumentShadowRemoval-
It aims to removing shadows from document images.  A dataset named "Optical Shadow Removal (OSR)" is proposed, which has been included in our paper "Local Water-Filling Algorithm for Shadow Detection and Removal of Document Images" published by "Sensors". 
If you use this dataset, please cite my paper.
